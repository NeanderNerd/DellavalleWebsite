        <h1>Agriculture</h1>
        <p>For growers we provide consultation regarding irrigation management, plant nutrition, soil fertility,
            salinity management and soil reclamation. We can assist with agricultural investigations for crop
            production problems and crop loss claims. Our laboratory can provide the analytical work to assist with
            such evaluations.</p>
        <h4>We Can Solve Problems</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Soil and plant tissue analyses can provide information for correcting nutrient deficiencies or
                excesses, or confirming that everything is satisfactory.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Our consultants can often determine the probable cause of problems with field inspection.</li>
            <li>We can analyze your irrigation water to assure nutrient and salinity levels are suitable for your
                crops.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Improve (Increase) Yields</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>&nbsp;Overcome production limitations caused by nutrient deficiencies, soil salinity, mineral
                toxicity or water use.</li>
            <li>Use consultantsâ€™ recommendations to optimize fertilizer, soil amendment and irrigation management.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reduce Costs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze your soil, tissue and water to establish the current nutrient needs for your crop.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Take a look at our Sampling Guide.
                Know your crop's needs to eliminate unnecessary fertilizer purchases.</li>
            <li>&nbsp;Monitor your crop's water use to possibly reduce your use of water and power.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Maximize Water Efficiency</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Monitor soil moisture with a neutron probe to provide a basis for an irrigation plan - when and how
                much water.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Evaluate Land Prior to Acquisition</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>With analyses of property's soil and water, we can determine if it meets your objectives.</li>
            <li>Appropriate rootstock/crops and fertilizer programs can be recommended, based on soil conditions.
            </li>
            <li>Appropriate reclamation steps can be provided for various situations (alkalinity, hardpan or even
                excavation).</li>
        </ul>
