            <h1>Accreditation</h1>
            <p>To insure quality results, Dellavalle utilizes internal quality control checks with replicate samples,
                matrix spikes, external or control samples and method blanks. Additionally, we employ Good Laboratory
                Practices (GLP). Our performance is evaluated by Californiaâ€™s Environmental Laboratory Accreditation
                Program for water and wastewater and the North American Proficiency Testing program for manure, compost,
                soil, plant tissue and ag water.</p>
