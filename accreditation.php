                    &emsp;To insure quality results, Dellavalle utilizes internal quality control checks with replicate
                    samples,
                    matrix spikes, external or control samples and method blanks. Additionally, we employ Good
                    Laboratory
                    Practices (GLP). Our performance is evaluated by Californiaâ€™s Environmental Laboratory Accreditation
                    Program for water and wastewater and the North American Proficiency Testing program for manure,
                    compost, soil, plant tissue and ag water.
