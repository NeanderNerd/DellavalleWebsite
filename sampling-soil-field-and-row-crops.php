<h1>Soil: Field &amp; Row Crops</h1>
	<p>Samples are collected from the top 12 inches of soil with a soil probe.  A shovel can be used if care is taken to assure a good vertical representation of the 0 to 12 inch profile.</p>
	<p>Results will vary widely if soil amendment or fertilizer injection bands become part of the sample.  It is best to avoid these bands or take a high number of random samples.</p>
	<p>Nutrients are often better evaluated by petiole or leaf samples because root-depth and position of residual fertilizer levels vary, changing the amount of nutrients available to the plant.  Tissue sampling will determine what the plant is absorbing; see
