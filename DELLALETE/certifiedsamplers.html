<h5>Certified Sampling Technicians</h5>
<p>Our certified samplers are trained in proper sampling techniques.  They are experienced with the collection of plant parts, soils, manures, fertilizers, waters and other media.</p>
<p>Attention is given to special analysis requests (pesticides, pathogens, etc.) regarding the correct handling of samples:  types of containers, sample refrigeration, etc. Let us schedule your sample collection.</p>
<p>Dellavalle currently employs three California Certified Water Distribution Operators (D1) and one Certified Water Treatment Operator (T1).  With this specialized training in water distribution and treatment, we can assist with your water system’s operating needs.   They can be a liaison with the local and State Health Departments to keep the water system in compliance with all regulatory requirements, and can assist with system mapping, quality control and public relations.</p>
