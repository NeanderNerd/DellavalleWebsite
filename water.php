<h1>Water</h1>
	<p>Dellavalle Laboratory offers water services to both domestic and agricultural clientele. Take a look at what we offer.</p>
	<h4>Domestic Water</h4>
	<p>The State requires all water systems to test drinking water for specific regulated compounds. If you have a private well, it is not required but periodic testing is advisable.</p>
	<p>Coliform bacteria testing for all domestic water is important. Coliform is a group of bacteria which includes E. coli and can cause flu-like symptoms.</p>
	<p>Often for property sales in the San Joaquin Valley, lenders require coliform, nitrate and DBCP testing. Depending on the situation other analyses may be appropriate: General Mineral, Inorganic Chemical, Household are just a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;

	<h4>Agricultural Water</h4>
	<p>How much nitrogen is being applied by your water? Is there enough nitrogen to save a purchase of fertilizer? Is too much salt coming from your water source? Is your water source good for your crop</p>
	<p>Through analyses of your agricultural water, Dellavalle provides information you need to successfully water your crop. We can help save you money on fertilizer if your water is already applying a fair share.</p>
	<p>Our consultants are available to assist you with your water's quality. Call for details. Analyze your irrigation water now. All it takes is a 250 ml clean plastic bottle.
With E. coli found on some vegetable crops it might be advisable to test your ag wells also.</p>
	<p>Of course, knowing the agricultural suitability of your water is useful for your crops.</p>
	<h4>Wastewater</h4>
	<p>In California, there are environmental concerns regarding wastewater treatment plants, food waste dischargers (packing houses, food processors) and confined livestock operations (primarily dairies).</p>
	<p>Dellavalle staff has been active in assisting private firms meet the various requirements to satisfy environmental concerns.</p>
	<p>For dairies managing influent/effluent is important as it can impact water quality. In line with this the dairies will need to document nutrient application, crop nutrient uptake and identify management practices that will reduce air pollution. With new regulations being developed, improving each dairyâ€™s environmental performance is important.</p>
	<p>Our Certified Soil Scientists/Agronomists are experienced with these concerns. They can act as liaison between you and any regulatory agency including California Regional Water Quality Control Board (CRWQCB). Appropriate samples can be collected from your monitoring wells, lagoons, effluents/influents and treatment ponds. The waters will be analyzed and our professionals can interpret the results and provide written reports. Monitoring reports often include BOD and nitrogen loading information.</p>
	<p>Dairies are regulated by several agencies including the CRWQCB from whom we received approved laboratory status. Others involved are the Air Pollution Control Board, the County where the dairy is located and other Federal and State groups.</p>
	<p>We are helping you save the future of our water supply and keep our environment safe.</p>
