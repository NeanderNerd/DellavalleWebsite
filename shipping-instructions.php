                courier can pick up your samples for a fee.</p>
            <p>It is always acceptable to ship samples by mail, UPS, Fed Ex, bus or a private courier; overnight
                shipment is best.</p>
            <h3>Soil and Plant Tissue Samples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Place soil/plant tissue sample bags in cardboard box and seal. Do not pack tissues samples tightly
                    as they may mold, and never package in plastic.
                    <strong>Remember to include a completed <a href="forms.php">Work Request Form</a> and return with
                        sample.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>If samples originate outside Fresno County, label your package near your return address with the
                following information: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is inside the package (Soil for Analysis) and from where the sample originates (county and
                    state).</li>
                <li>Due to Fresno Countyâ€™s Red Fire ant alert, packages without this information may be delayed,
                    confiscated or destroyed by the County Ag Inspectors. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Arrange for samples to arrive Monday through Friday as we are not open on weekends.</p>
            <h3>Water Samples:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All water samples should be sent in a cooler with <strong>plenty</strong> of ice.</li>
                <li>Be sure to use indelible ink on bottle labels as water from melted ice may wash away writing.
                    Enclosing sample bottles in zipped plastic bags helps to prevent sample contamination.</li>
                <li>Be sure to complete and return a Work Request Form with sample.</li>
                <li>Ship sample overnight for arrival Monday through Thursday.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Samples arriving on Friday may not be able to be analyzed in a timely manner. If testing begins after the
                weekend, then sample may be noncompliant for hold time.</p>
